    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <div> Hello! My name is Cain and welcome to my website! So glad to have you here,
      please take your time exploring my site reading about me, checking out some of my
      personal art and favorite music.

    <div>
      A little bit more about me I am a 3rd year student at U of M in Missoula,
      Montana currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in media arts with a minor in business
      administration. Originally from the 'Motorcycle Capitol of the World'
      Sturgis, SD I migrated to Missoula in early 2018 and was instantly
      drawn in by the charm and grandeur of the Rockies. After college I would
      like to pursue a career in product & graphic design and eventually operate
      my own design company. I love Missoula but plan on moving west after graduation
      to pursue my career in either Oregon or Washington State.

      I enjoy spending my free time listening to music, going to the gym,
      starting a new anime series or picking up my guitar to jam. You can check out
      some of my work as well as my favorite coding playlist on the art page located
      in the navigation bar!
