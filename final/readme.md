#Final

I have to say that I have learned more about coding and website design in the past 4 months than I had in 22 years. I feel like I was really able to dig into coding this semester after having a crash course in creative coding. I feel much more confident about file structure, CSS pages, Image placement, media integration, color, and everything else that goes into building a website. I am not anywhere close to a web developer, but I am proud of how much I have learned about coding within the past year. It is something that I find useful and enjoyable and foresee myself continuing with in the future. Of course I didn't go without struggles on this final project. The thing that I struggled with the most and coincidentally spent the moist time on was the positioning of multiple media elements on my art page. I found a structural workaround using classes and that made my project much easier and allowed me to give the page a cleaner look. I also struggled to fill my home page with things that were not images or text. My home page is pretty bland, But I was unsure how to make it look usable and decorative at the same time without cluttering it with media. So I still have a long ways to go, but I am happy with my progress so far and with how this project turned out for me.  

Thank you Mr. Cassens for a wonderful semester and I hope to be in another one of your classes again soon!

Best,
Cain Fritz
