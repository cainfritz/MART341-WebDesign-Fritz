    <h3>The Homework Machine<h3>
    <h4><h4>
  <p>The Homework Machine,
Oh, the Homework Machine,
    <br />
Most perfect
    <br />
contraption that's ever been seen.
    <br />
Just put in your homework, then drop in a dime,
    <br />
Snap on the switch, and in ten seconds' time,
    <br />
Your homework comes out, quick and clean as can be.
    <br />
Here it is— 'nine plus four?' and the answer is 'three.'
    <br />
Three?
    <br />
Oh me . . .
    <br />
I guess it's not as perfect
    <br />
As I thought it would be.</p>

    <h3>How Not to Have to Dry the Dishes<h3>
    <h4><h4>
  <p>If you have to dry the dishes
    <br />
(Such an awful, boring chore)
    <br />
If you have to dry the dishes
    <br />
('Stead of going to the store)
    <br />
If you have to dry the dishes
    <br />
And you drop one on the floor—
    <br />
Maybe they won't let you
    <br />
Dry the dishes anymore.</p>
