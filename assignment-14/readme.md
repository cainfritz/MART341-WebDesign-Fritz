#Assignment-14

I decided to use Bulma as my Library because It seemed the most versatile while still simple enough to use. I like it so far and the freedom allowed with it. I think that next time I would try bootstrap to see the difference between the two.

I used the CDN method to host my framework because it was much simpler and easier for me to quickly reference it rather than hosting all of the coding files.

HTML 5 changes the web by streamlining efficiency and effectiveness. HTML 5 can do more than previous versions all while hosting more content faster than before, offering more device access, and emphasizing multimedia content.

This week I struggled to find exactly which framework was best for me and how to integrate it into my project. I eventually decided to reference Bulma using the CDN method and hosting remotely. This seemed to work the best for me as it was quick and storage-effective.
