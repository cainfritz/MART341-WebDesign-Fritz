padding is the space in the element separating the text from the border. While Margin is the space outside the box. A border is self-explanatory as it borders whatever content is inside of it.

I tried to make this week fun and creative while trying to fit all the requirements. I found it
frustrating how I could not figure out how to make my transparent image actually
transparent on my page. Other than that I enjoyed playing around with borders and Positioning
this week.
