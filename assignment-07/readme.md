#Assignment 07

Forms across the web serve many purposes depending on what function they are serving.
For example login and registration forms are incredibly popular across the web.

just like forms we find that, text, selections and button input all serve specific
functions for a site depending on their application and situation.

I have noticed that my work cycle requires me to take more than one look at my code to
properly include all the elements I would like. For example, I get the code itself
down pretty quickly to build a rough scaffolding for the site, and I return later
to place all details and tweak with colors and image sizes.
