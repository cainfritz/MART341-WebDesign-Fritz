# Assignment 08
The div tag is block tag that identifies divisions in the section
of the HTMl doc and is used as a
container for it's different elements. The class tag is used to define the class
or a certain type of code that follows a pre-specified format.
The Id tag defines an identifier used in linking, scripting or styling
another element of the HTML document. The span tag is similar to the div tag
in that it is used to mark up part of the text in a document, but the span tag
is an inline element, rather than a block element.

There are some major pros and cons to using a service like youtube or vimeo to
host your videos. One major advantage is the amount of content that is available
on those sites. I had trouble finding a video of what I wanted that did NOT exist
on youtube. A major disadvantage however, is tiptoeing around the copywritten
material of vimeo or youtube. I had run into this problem this week in my own
site and it resulted in the site not running as smoothly as I had hoped.

I had faced some major challenges this week mostly in embedding video and audio in my site
and getting them to work properly. I found a workaround with my audio, but I had to
locally service it, rather than host it from another site, but at least I was
able to get the song I wanted on my site in the end. I think it will take some
time for me to get used to properly linking video and audio, but it is a
necessary skill in modern website building.
