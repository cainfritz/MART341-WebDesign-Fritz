Week 02 - this week we discussed files and naming structures as well as uploading files and taking screenshots on github. Thanks to creative coding 
I was already familiar with github and how to upload and access files. 

Week 03 - This week I became much more confident with file placement within my directory. We also learned the importance of IP address, DNS, 
relative and absolute URL's, and the anatomy of a URL.

Week 04 - This week we discussed the importance of markup languages and browsers and what they can do for us. This week I struggled with arranging my files
and struggled to get my files were I desired them to go. 

Week 05 - This week we dove into creating websites with the basic elements of HTML. I think mine turned out fairly well and I structured my 
directory well enough that I was able to reference all of my images correctly the first time around. 

Week 07 - This week we mastered forms, tables and buttons as well as many other practical applications. 
I found the forms challenging but rewarding once shown the final product.
