Week 02 - this week we discussed files and naming structures as well as uploading files and taking screenshots on github. Thanks to creative coding 
I was already familiar with github and how to upload and access files. 

Week 03 - This week I became much more confident with file placement within my directory. We also learned the importance of IP address, DNS, 
relative and absolute URL's, and the anatomy of a URL.
