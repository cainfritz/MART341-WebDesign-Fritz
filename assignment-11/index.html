  <h1>The Great Gatsby</h1>
  <h3 class="center">By F. Scott Fitzgerald</h3>

      "They were careless people, Tom and Daisy — they
smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into
their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that
kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess
they had made…

      I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child. Then he went into the
jewelry store to buy a pearl necklace — or perhaps only a pair
of cuff buttons — rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.
Gatsby’s house was still empty when I left — the grass on his
lawn had grown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the
village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside; perhaps it was he who
drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the accident, and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own. I
didn’t want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off the
train.

    <div class= "main-paragraph">
      I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those
gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I
could still hear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant,
from his garden, and the cars going up and down his drive.
One night I did hear a material car there, and saw its lights
stop at his front steps. But I didn’t investigate. Probably it was
some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth
and didn’t know that the party was over.
On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to
the grocer, I went over and looked at that huge incoherent
failure of a house once more. On the white steps an obscene word,
scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in
the moonlight, and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly
along the stone. Then I wandered down to the beach and
sprawled out on the sand.

    <br></br>
    <div class= "main-paragraph">
      Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were
hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat
across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became
aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors’ eyes —
a fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s house,
had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all
human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must
have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood
nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with
something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.
    </div>
    <br></br>
    <div class= "main-paragraph">
      And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I
thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green
light at the end of Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this
blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he
could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was
already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity
beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on
under the night.
    </div>
    <br></br>
    <div class= "main-paragraph">
        Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that
year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no
matter — to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms
farther… . And one fine morning ——
So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."
