# Assignment 11
a system font is one that lives on your machine and is used in applications
such as microsoft word or adobe, while a web font is one that exists on the web
typically available for download. A web-safe font is one that transfers perfectly
from a non web device to the internet without losing the specified font.

That is why fallback fonts and font stacks are important. In the event that a font does not transfer to the web due to sourcing issues or any other variables, fallback fonts take the place of a specified font so that it does not lose all of it's styling completely.

I struggled this week with sourcing fonts on my own site. At first I attempted to download and host my  fonts on my own machine, but I was missing something somewhere, so I worked around it and @ imported my fonts from google which worked just as well. unfortunately google did not have all the fonts I wanted but it was enough to reach completion on my project. It was a good crash course on fonts for me, and I am excited to use these styling techniques on my future projects
