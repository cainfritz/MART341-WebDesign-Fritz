#assignment-13

This week I struggled to find a client and focused more on the structure of my pages
and files before I get carried away with trying to style it for a potential client.
I am somewhat satisfied with how it turned out, even though rather bland, I felt
confident in my file structure and page references.

I think that mobile-first design is very important as our interaction with online
websites is becoming increasingly more mobile. I find myself doing as much research
on my phone as my computer, so for this reason I think a user-friendly website
is essential.

Like I said I wanted to focus more on the structure of my pages and files this week
to keep everything straight. Even though it may not be stylized to the 9's I felt
confident in the navigation and structure of my files.
