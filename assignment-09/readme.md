#Assignment-09

most of HTML is new to me, but I am familiar with the very basics such as the
HTML, head, title, and style tags. However I struggle with getting the page to look
exactly how I want at times. I understand most of the styling concepts but at times
struggle to identify which one to use.

That is great news to hear that we will be expanding styling in the next module.
I find styling one of the most rewarding attributes of an HTML site so I cannot
wait to explore different techniques structures and styles.

I have had struggles this past week customizing my page to look readable and
not as skeletal as some of my other projects. That is why I decided to center my
index page this week to give it a more professional feel than the standard
left-aligned text site I usually submit. I think it turned out okay, but I feel
I am missing something to make it more cohesive overall.
