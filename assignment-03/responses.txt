This is my response
1. Three websites I enjoy visiting
 - [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/)
 - [MART 341 Website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/341-web-design-Spring2021/)
 - [Github](https://github.com/)

2. An IP address is a unique number attached to a specific device that
allows that device to send and receive information. The DNS or Domain Name
System is a naming system for computers or services. Each IP address is
attached to a DNS address and vice versa. The difference is, however
that the IP address is displayed in numerical format and the DNS is
alphabetical. This is similar to each person's name and phone number being
in a phone book, they are both attached to one person and information can be
found using one or the other.

3. Cookies, in the internet sense, are little pieces of information stored
on a computer's web browser that are designed to remember information about
the visiting user and even personal and login information.

4. The essential parts of a URL are the protocol, domain, path, and file

5. Things I have learned so far
 - I learned the difference between referencing relative links and absolute
 links
 - I also learned how to write and stylize in markdown language
 - The third thing I learned this week is that if a file is below or deeper
 within a directory, It will not show up without referencing it's file name
