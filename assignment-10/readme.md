# Assignment 10
Universal applies to everything which sounds better than it is but can be useful in some situations. At first I tried that approach and hated how limiting it was to the rest of my site. Element assigns one element such as the H1 tag a specific styling, which is nice, unless you want to use that Element again later and it still has the same style. Then it must be differentiated or styled in-line. Class is more applicable in that you can have a normal H1 tag and then use the class attribute to style individually, and I personally like this approach and will probably use it more going forward. And Finally ID is the one I am Least sure on, but from what I understand It is similar to class in that it must be called upon to be used in the HTML doc.

I wanted to stick with something retro and dark with mid-century elements so I chose the colors Teal Orange and Black. I wanted the site all black with the accents to provide a chic feel. I found out how much I like those colors together.

I had some struggles positioning my pictures and content this week, but after some tinkering I had figured it out. This time I started with the bare bones and added things in as I thought of them, rather than aiming for a big picture concept, and I enjoyed this approach. I didn't find that I had worked myself into any corners as long as I kept my options open and style sheet clean.
